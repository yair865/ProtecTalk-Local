**ProtecTalk** is an innovative app designed to combat the growing threat of telephone scams, especially those that rely on a series of calls to build trust and manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive bank information or transferring money. The app runs automatically in the background, continuously monitoring incoming calls. It transcribes suspicious conversations and uses AI to analyze and calculate the probability of fraud. When a high-risk call is detected, ProtecTalk sends a post-call alert to the user or a designated contact, ensuring that someone is informed and can take appropriate action. At the end of an unknown caller interaction, ProtecTalk performs this analysis and alert process automatically, ensuring that users are protected even if they arenâ€™t actively monitoring the call.
